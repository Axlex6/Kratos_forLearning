## 1. Introduction

In the first tutorial you have successfully installed Kratos and confirmed it works, but in order to run a real simulation you will need some files that define your problem. This sections aims to cover which are the essential files that you need to run a full fledged simulation and start to play with some of the Kratos base structures.

There are three different types of files that compose a Kratos simulation:
* `.py`: A python script to run Kratos
* `.json`: Contains settings for Kratos
* `.mdpa`: Contains the model part information

These files are usually created by a GUI (GiD, Salome, Flowgraph) and used to directly start the simulation. As the aim of the course is not to learn how to use these tools, you can download the input files for a simple structural mechanics case [here](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Documentation/raw/refs/heads/master/Workshops_files/Kratos_Workshop_2019/Sources/2_Kratos_input_files_and_IO/2_Kratos_input_files_and_IO.zip).**

## 2. The Kratos python script
### 2.1. MainKratos.py
The most important file that you have downloade is called `MainKratos.py` and as its name suggest is a python script. This would be the equivalent to your well known `.exe` for a classic problem, with the advantage that you can customize it according to your needs. It is responsible to load the required Kratos applications and to call the main Kratos functionalities as desired by the user. 

Let's look at the content of this file for our structural analysis example:

```python
import KratosMultiphysics
from KratosMultiphysics.StructuralMechanicsApplication.structural_mechanics_analysis import StructuralMechanicsAnalysis

if __name__ == "__main__":

    with open("ProjectParameters.json", 'r') as parameter_file:
        parameters = KratosMultiphysics.Parameters(parameter_file.read())

    model = KratosMultiphysics.Model()
    simulation = StructuralMechanicsAnalysis(model, parameters)
    simulation.Run()
```

In the first lines, Kratos and the structural analysis are imported. Then the settings are read from the `.json` and a Model is created. Finaly we use all that information to create a `StructuralMechanicsAnalysis` simulation. In the last line, the structural simulation executed. 

It's important to notice that, while this script works and its correct, it is not the only correct way to initialize a Kratos simluation. As we will see by the end of the Crash course, there are more advanced usages.

### 2.2. Run Kratos from the command line
Let's jump in and try the code:

Use the Kratos command prompt from your Kratos installation, navigate to the folder where your script is located and execute:

```
python MainKratos.py
```

If everything went well, you should have two folders with different output formats: The GiD post file ends with `.post.bin` and can be drag and droppen into GiD. Additionally VTK files are written to the VTK_Output folder. 

## 3. The project parameters file
While you have used the `MainKratos.py` script to indicate some basic options for the simulation to work, the settings for a Kratos are stored in a `.json` file. 

JSON is an open-standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs. Kratos uses a thin wrapper arround this syntax, the `Parameters` object. 

This section is a short version of a more detailed [description about the JSON syntax](How-to-write-a-JSON-configuration-file) and a [tutorial on how to read and use it](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Python-Script-Tutorial:-Reading-ProjectParameters).

### 3.1 ProjectParameters.json
The project parameters file for Kratos is commonly named `ProjectParameters.json`. Let's look at the content of this file for our structural analysis example. It contains four main blocks:

* `problem_data`: General settings for the Kratos run
* `solver_settings`: Settings for the solvers, like analysis type, linear solver, etc.
* `processes`: Processes to e.g. apply boundary conditions.  
* `output_processes`: Settings for the output

Try to change the end time of the structural case from to `5.0` seconds and run the analysis again.

## 4. The Model and ModePart files
In KratosMultiphyscis, the information about your mesh is stored in a data structure named `Model`. The model is responsible of everything related with the geometrical part of Kratos. Only one can exist per simulation and will typically contain several `ModelParts`. The serialization of this modelparts. is what we call an `.mdpa`(**M**o**d**el**Pa**rt) and is your third input file.

It contains blocks for properties, nodes, elements, conditions and initial values. In addition the mesh entities can be grouped into sub model parts. A detailed description of the syntax is given [here](Input-data).

Don't worry to much about this right now as we will dip deeper into this file and how to read it. For now just asume that the `StructuralMechanicsAnalysis` is able to read it with the information in the `ProjectParameters.json`:

```json
"model_import_settings" : {
    "input_type"     : "mdpa",
    "input_filename" : "KratosWorkshop2019_high_rise_building_CSM"
},
```


### 4.1 Read a .mdpa file
The following exercise is a short version of a more detailed [tutorial](Python-Script-Tutorial:-Reading-ModelPart-From-Input-File).

A `ModelPart` has to be created via a `Model` object, which can contain several `ModelParts`. Right after creating the empty `ModelPart`, the variables needed for the following calculations have to be added. The empty `ModelPart` is then filled using the `ModelPartIO` that reads the information from an .mdpa file. In general, the analysis object takes care of these steps, especially because it knows which variables to add.

Generaly, you will not have to deal with the lecture of a ModelPart, but 

Here you will do it directly in your python script. 
If the .mdpa file contains application dependent elements, the corresponding Kratos application has to be imported. In our structural example, the elements are from the `StructuralMechanicsApplication`. 

Extend the small python script from the first part of the exercise with the following lines:

```python
import KratosMultiphysics.StructuralMechanicsApplication

this_model = KratosMultiphysics.Model()
this_model_part = this_model.CreateModelPart("MyModelPart")

# Adding variables BEFORE reading the .mdpa
this_model_part.AddNodalSolutionStepVariable(KratosMultiphysics.DISPLACEMENT)

model_part_io = KratosMultiphysics.ModelPartIO("KratosWorkshop2019_high_rise_building_CSM") #path to file without ".mdpa"
model_part_io.ReadModelPart(this_model_part)
```
You could also use the filename that you extracted from the ProjectParameters.json previously.

_Hint: You can_ ```>>> print(this_model_part)``` _to see its content._ 

## Output
An extensive example on writing GiD output can be found [here](Python-Script-Tutorial:-Writing-Output-File). In this part of the tutorial you will create a minimal configuration of a VTK output process. 

The `vtk_output` block in the ProjectParameters.json gives you an impression on the potential settings for the output. Here you will create just a minimal version of it.
```python
from vtk_output_process import VtkOutputProcess
vtk_output_configuration = KratosMultiphysics.Parameters("""{
        "model_part_name"        : \""""+this_model_part.Name+"""\",
        "output_sub_model_parts" : false,
        "nodal_solution_step_data_variables" : ["DISPLACEMENT"]
    }""")

vtk_output = VtkOutputProcess(this_model, vtk_output_configuration)
```

The output process is usually called at defined places inside the analysis. In order to use it, several functions need to be called in the right order.

```python
vtk_output.ExecuteInitialize()
vtk_output.ExecuteBeforeSolutionLoop()
vtk_output.ExecuteInitializeSolutionStep()
vtk_output.PrintOutput()
vtk_output.ExecuteFinalizeSolutionStep()
vtk_output.ExecuteFinalize()
```
