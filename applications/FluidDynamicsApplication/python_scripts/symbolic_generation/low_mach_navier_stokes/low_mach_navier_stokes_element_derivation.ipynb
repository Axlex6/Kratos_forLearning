    "This formulation comes from a simplification of the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equation and is suitable for the resolution of low speed strongly thermally coupled flows.\n",
    "Specifically, the formulation indroduces the low Mach limit simplification, which allows to split the total pressure into two parts, a thermodynamic part $p_{th}$ that is uniform in space and a mechanical (hydrodynamic) one $p$.\n",
    "It is important to note that $p$ is several orders of magnitude smaller than $p_{th}$ and is therefore omitted from the state and energy equations.\n",
    "In other words, the compressibility of the fluid comes from the thermal effects only.\n",
    "Hence, the problem to be considered is finding a velocity field $\\bm{u}$, mechanical pressure $p$, temperature field $T$ and thermodynamic pressure $p_{th}$ such that\n",
