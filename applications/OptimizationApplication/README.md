# OptimizationApplication

The Kratos OptimizationApplication is a framework for solving multi-scale optimization problems in continuum mechanics. It is supposedto handle both gradient-based and gradient-free methods. 

It can be used in combination with the Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis capabilities of the Kratos StructuralMechanicsApplication and ConvectionDiffusionApplication. 
Additionally it offers an interface to use external response functions via custom python code.
