# Contributing to Kratos Multiphysics
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Proposing new features
- Submitting a fix
- Becoming a maintainer

## Reporting a bug

Please open an issue in order to report a bug. A template for bugs is provided.

## Discussing the current state of the code

Please open an issue in order to give any comment about the current state of the code. We also provide several templates for discussions and questions.

Feedback is needed!

## Proposing new features

Please open an issue, or if you are already a developer and brave enough open a PR with the proposed changes ;). We have specific templates for the requests.

## Submitting a fix

If you are already a developer, please create a new branch with the proposed changes. Then create a **Pull Request** (**PR**) and request a review. 

The structure of the branch must be: `subject/short-description`. For example for a fix in the core of a given utility: `core/fix-xxx-utility`. We separate the words using `-`.

If you are not developer, fork this project and open a **PR** with the proposed fix. You can become a developer, see next section.
